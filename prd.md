# 7. Risk Analysis and Migration Strategy

## 7.1. Identified Risks
- **Storage Performance:**  
  - Supabase Storage may reach performance limits as the video upload volume increases.
- **Video Transcoding:**  
  - The lack of built-in transcoding in Supabase might require third-party services for automated processing.
- **Real-Time Load:**  
  - High concurrent interactions (likes, comments) could lead to performance bottlenecks.

## 7.2. Mitigation and Migration Plan
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Regularly track storage, API response times, and real-time interaction performance.
- **Hybrid Approach:**  
  - Begin with Supabase for MVP functionality.  
  - Gradually transition high-load operations (e.g., video storage, transcoding) to AWS services (S3, CloudFront, MediaConvert) if necessary.
- **Optimization:**  
  - Utilize caching, lazy loading, and efficient state management (using React Context and reducers) to minimize performance overhead.

As the user base expands, the system can be augmented with AWS services for storage, transcoding, and global content delivery.

**Next Steps:**
1. Break down tasks and set up the development backlog.
2. Create wireframes and prototypes (using Figma) to validate the UI/UX.
3. Set up the development environment on macOS and configure the CI/CD pipeline.
4. Develop the MVP and initiate early user testing to gather feedback.
5. Monitor performance and plan for potential integration of AWS services as needed.
