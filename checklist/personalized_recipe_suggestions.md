Below is an overview of how a personalized recipe recommendation or “Personalized Feed” might look based on your current codebase references, along with a possible approach for implementing it. Since you asked not to include line numbers in code snippets, the examples will simply be shown as standard code blocks.

---

## 1. Existing References in Your Codebase

From what’s visible in “@dynamic_recipe_implementation.md” and elsewhere, there are references to:  
• “Personalized Feed Integration” as a feature that factors in AI interactions to suggest recipes based on variation preferences and user interaction patterns.  
• A potential file named services/recipeRecommendations.ts.  
• A mention of hooking into a feed or recommendation system that uses data such as user preferences, AI-agent interactions, or saved variations to tailor recipe suggestions.

Essentially, the plan is to combine the user’s previous interactions (which recipes they’ve looked at, what variations they’ve requested, their dietary restrictions, etc.) with an algorithm—potentially assisted by your AI services—to deliver personalized recipe items in a feed or “Recommended for You” section.

---

## 2. Data Points for Personalization

1. User Preferences & Dietary Restrictions  
   • E.g., vegetarian, vegan, low-carb, gluten-free, etc.  
   • Could be stored in a user_profile table or embedded in your user model.

2. RecipeVariation or User Activity Data  
   • If a user frequently requests certain types of variations (e.g., “dairy-free” or “low-calorie”), you can use that to recommend new recipes that align with those preferences.

3. Interaction History & Feedback  
   • Logged interactions, such as how often a user “likes” certain recipes or explicitly rates AI suggestions.  
   • If you store feedback such as “helpful / not helpful,” that can be fed back into the system.

## 3. Example of a Recommendation Service

Below is a simple illustration of how services/recipeRecommendations.ts might look, drawing on your existing patterns for modular services:

```typescript:services/recipeRecommendations.ts
import { prisma } from '../lib/prisma';
// Or your DB client, e.g., Supabase or Prisma
import { getUserPreferences } from './userPreferences';
import { getUserHistory } from './userHistory'; 
// Hypothetical modules to retrieve user info

export async function getPersonalizedRecommendations(userId: string) {
  // 1. Fetch user preferences (e.g., dietary restrictions, favored diets)
  const preferences = await getUserPreferences(userId);

  // 2. Get user activity or history (e.g., liked recipes, requested variations)
  const userHistory = await getUserHistory(userId);

  // 3. Combine preferences & history to create a query or scoring logic
  //    This can be as simple or advanced as you like, possibly with
  //    weighting for certain categories or an AI-based approach.
  
  // Example: filter recipes by user’s dietary restrictions, then rank by
  // number of matching tags with user’s preferred style
  const recommendedRecipes = await prisma.video.findMany({
    where: {
      category: {
        in: preferences.preferredCategories
      }
      // Optionally add dietary filters, exclude disliked tags, etc.
    },
    orderBy: {
      // Some basic heuristic, e.g. "popularity" or a custom score
      createdAt: 'desc'
    },
    take: 10
  });

  // 4. Return the recommended data
  return recommendedRecipes;
}
```

1. getUserPreferences might retrieve JSON or fields like “preferredCategories” (COOKING, DINNER, DESSERT), “dietaryRestrictions” (gluten_free, etc.), or “favoriteFlavors.”  
2. getUserHistory might look at a table that logs user actions: which recipes they liked, which recommended variations they used, or how they rated certain AI suggestions.  
3. The final result is a list of recipe posts that you can display in a “Recommended for You” feed.

---

## 4. Integrating AI Interactions

Since your system already uses an AI-Agent for recipe variations, you can feed that data back into your personalized feed logic. For instance:  
• If the user frequently asks the AI for vegan or dairy-free variants, increment an internal “vegan interest” score.  
• If the user rates those suggestions positively, further reinforce that preference.  
• Next time the user opens the feed, the system can preemptively highlight recipes that either:  
  – Are already vegan.  
  – Can be easily converted via substitution.  

A simple approach in getUserHistory might look like this:

```typescript
export async function getUserHistory(userId: string) {
  // Hypothetical calls
  const variationUsage = await prisma.recipeVariation.findMany({
    where: { userId }
  });
  // Could also track AI feedback or any “like” events

  // Summarize or transform into a data structure 
  // that shows top user keywords, tags, or dietary patterns
  const aggregatedPreferences = analyzeVariationUsage(variationUsage);

  return aggregatedPreferences; // e.g., { veganCount: 5, sugarFreeCount: 2, ... }
}
```

The field aggregatedPreferences might then be used in your main recommendation logic to prioritize relevant recipes.

## 5. Displaying Recommendations in the UI

You would likely have a PersonalizedFeed component (or a tab) that fetches and renders the recommended recipes:

```typescript:app/(tabs)/PersonalizedFeed.tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { getPersonalizedRecommendations } from '@/services/recipeRecommendations';

export function PersonalizedFeed({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const recs = await getPersonalizedRecommendations(userId);
      setRecommendations(recs);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, [userId]);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Recommended For You</Text>
      {recommendations.map((recipe) => (
        <Text key={recipe.id}>{recipe.title}</Text>
      ))}
    </View>
  );
}
```

---

## 6. Possible Enhancements

• Weighting by Recency or Popularity: The user might see fresher or trending recipes at the top.  
• AI Summaries in the Feed: Next to each recommended recipe, you could invoke the AI agent to highlight “why this recipe is recommended for you.”  
• More Fine-Grained Scoring: Incorporate user’s cooking skill level, time constraints, or even local ingredients to further refine suggestions.  
• Experimental Approaches: Use a machine learning model (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering) with explicit and implicit feedback (clickthrough rate, rating stars, etc.).

---

### Summary

You already have references and partial components in place that mention “Personalized Feed Integration.” Building a fully personalized recipe recommendation means:  
1. Defining how to store and retrieve user preferences (diet, categories, etc.).  
2. Tracking user interactions with the AI agent and their choice of recipe variations.  
3. Combining these data points in a recommendation service (services/recipeRecommendations.ts).  
4. Rendering the recommended recipes in the UI through a dedicated “Personalized Feed” component.  

That’s how a personal recipe recommendation could look in your app, leveraging existing concepts from your codebase (like the AI agent and your user preference data).
