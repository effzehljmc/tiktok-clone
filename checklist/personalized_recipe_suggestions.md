   - [ ] Fix preference matching calculation:
     - Debug incorrect 100% match scores
     - Ensure proper dietary preference filtering (e.g., vegan recipes for vegan users)
     - Add weight adjustments for strict dietary requirements
     - Validate ingredient matching logic
   - [ ] Add logging and monitoring for score calculations
   - [ ] Implement score validation and testing

2. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add preference-based sorting
   - [ ] Create recommendation refresh mechanism

3. **Performance & Caching**
   - [ ] Implement recommendation caching
   - [ ] Add query optimization
   - [ ] Create background refresh system
   - [ ] Implement lazy loading

## üìù To Do

1. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Implement collaborative filtering
   - [ ] Add machine learning based recommendations
   - [ ] Create similarity scoring system
   - [ ] Add recommendation history tracking

2. **Testing & Documentation**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for recommendation logic
